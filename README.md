- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick Palacio
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building software with great teams that users will love. 'If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together'
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure basics and whatever else needs a deep dive for what I am currently working on at work.

In my free time you might catch me practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, weight lifting, playing soccer or spending time with my wife and our 2 cats.

Here are some beliefs of mine that are core to who I am:
- I believe people always come first
   - No matter the situation or the problem at hand, things get solved in this world when people work together and that can only happen when they have a positive relationship
   - Whenever I am working on a problem at work you will always here me say things like 'the code, the build, etc.' as opposed to 'your code, your build, etc.' because words matter and almost all problems in an organziation are system failures not individual mistakes
- I believe in leadership at every level in an organization
   - Great things happen in organizations that let their frontline workers take initiative to solve the company's problems
- I believe in taking [Extreme Ownership](https://echelonfront.com/extreme-ownership/) in everything I do
   - My life started changing for the better when I started focusing on myself and things I can do to improve any situation I find myself in
- I believe in doing the little things extraordinarily well
   - In my mind, there are no big things in this world, just the accumulation of little things that can add up to something much bigger
